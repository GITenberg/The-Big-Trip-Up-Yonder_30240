description: The editor of GALAXY magazine, Horace Gold, was obsessed with social
  trends and their extrapolation. The prototypical GALAXY story (often parodied in
  the magazine itself) would take a present-day, often overlooked trend, fad or demographic
  fact and posit a society in which they had become dominant. Thus Fred Pohl's THE
  MIDAS PLAGUE in which obsessive consumerism and its unpleasant acquisitiveness had
  become negative social values. Thus Damon Knight's BACKWARD TURN BACKWARD in which
  the lifespan reversed (from grave to cradle) becomes a mockery of 1950's youth obsession.
  And thus THE BIG TRIP UP YONDER (January 1954) in which the increasing of the lifespan
  has led to a future America in which the old dominate simply because they will not
  die and yield their share of the diminishing stock of possessions...a circumstance
  which leads to the inevitable infantilism of the deprived younger generations. THE
  BIG TRIP UP YONDER is the second and last of the two stories which Kurt Vonnegut,
  a struggling mainstream writer and reluctant presence in science fiction, sold to
  GALAXY magazine. Characteristic of Vonnegut's work, it is framed as comedy but is
  deathly serious and confronts the issue of overextended mortality with unbending
  grimness. Vonnegut spent no more time hanging around the genre science fiction markets;
  it was another 18 years before THE BIG SPACE F--- appeared in AGAIN, DANGEROUS VISIONS
  and only did so because Vonnegut and that famous original anthology's editor, Harlan
  Ellison, were old friends.
